      <description>Web Fonts In my PHP group project I have been given the role of being the designer for the interface of the website. Since we are using CSS3 I decided that using font-face will help with the design, and it did, tremendously.
Here is the first version of the interface:

Now here is the redesign using web fonts (Actual link &amp;#8211; http://shopright.phonghuynh.ca):

Also with some colour changes but we are talking about fonts here.</description>

      <description>Have you ever had that little error that messed up your whole project? Back in programming, I remember when I used to miss variable names and the program would not run. However, Java would tell you exactly where the error is. This week I was working on my second assignment for Digital Design, which requires me to code my mock-up website from assignment 1 into html/css. I made the mistake of putting a pretty looking slider in the mock-up because I did not know this assignment was coming&amp;#8230; So for the website I had to use a jQuery slider plugin for my slider.</description>

      <description>ASP.NET The assignment asked to make two separate .aspx pages. The first page uses a data bound control loaded with information from a table in the database. When the user clicks on the data, it essentially loads the full details of the selected data. The second page uses templates to allow for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for the table. I spent all day googling how to create a button that dynamically loads another data bound control without using the autogenerate button.</description>
