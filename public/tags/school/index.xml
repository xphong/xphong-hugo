      <description>It has been around a year since I graduated and I can still remember how anxious I was about going into the workplace. After nearly a year of working in the industry, I feel that sharing my experiences will be helpful to those currently transitioning from school to the workplace.
Table of Contents  Background School Portfolio and Job Searching Interview Process The Future and Continuous Learning  Background A little bit about me: I interned as a junior web developer at an agency for a couple of months, got a full-time job at that same agency, and now I am currently working at a startup/software company.</description>

      <description>This post describes how to transfer/compare data between 2 databases. Before I start, to transfer data using Visual Studio you need to have:
VISUAL STUDIO 2010 ULTIMATE VERSION OR PREMIUM VERSION Most articles tend to leave this part out, this is a pain because you will open up your Visual Studio and wonder where the option is. Other versions of Visual Studio (2012, professional) do not have this tool installed.</description>

      <description>Web Fonts In my PHP group project I have been given the role of being the designer for the interface of the website. Since we are using CSS3 I decided that using font-face will help with the design, and it did, tremendously.
Here is the first version of the interface:

Now here is the redesign using web fonts (Actual link &amp;#8211; http://shopright.phonghuynh.ca):

Also with some colour changes but we are talking about fonts here.</description>

      <description>Have you ever had that little error that messed up your whole project? Back in programming, I remember when I used to miss variable names and the program would not run. However, Java would tell you exactly where the error is. This week I was working on my second assignment for Digital Design, which requires me to code my mock-up website from assignment 1 into html/css. I made the mistake of putting a pretty looking slider in the mock-up because I did not know this assignment was coming&amp;#8230; So for the website I had to use a jQuery slider plugin for my slider.</description>

      <description>ASP.NET The assignment asked to make two separate .aspx pages. The first page uses a data bound control loaded with information from a table in the database. When the user clicks on the data, it essentially loads the full details of the selected data. The second page uses templates to allow for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for the table. I spent all day googling how to create a button that dynamically loads another data bound control without using the autogenerate button.</description>

      <description>You should always be organizing your layers into a group when using Photoshop.
I was working on an assignment for my Digital Design class where I had to build a series of mock up web pages. The requested size was to fit the standard 1024 pixel screen width, but when I was working on it I had it at 960 pixel width.
When I realized that I had it at the wrong width I had already finished a couple of pages.</description>

      <description>The main purpose of this website was to create my programming portfolio and get it online.
Having a portfolio is extremely important when you are a computer programmer because it is a good way to showcase and explain your work. In addition, having a portfolio ready can put you ahead of many other candidates when looking for a job.</description>

      <description>An assignment for my Web Application Development class. For this assignment I had to create two forms that both use validation groups to validate the fields. One of the forms must use either Wizard Steps or Multiview. I chose Wizard Steps.
Problem:
Validation was not working for the wizard steps even though everything was coded perfectly.
&amp;lt;asp:WizardStep id=”wds_2″ runat=”server” title=”Account Info”&amp;gt; &amp;lt;asp:Label ID=”lbl_username” runat=”server” Text=”Username: ” AssociatedControlID=”txt_username” /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;asp:TextBox ID=”txt_username” runat=”server” /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID=”rfv_username” runat=”server” ControlToValidate=”txt_username” display=”Dynamic” Text=”Empty value” ErrorMessage=”Please enter username.</description>

      <description>After finally getting my website uploaded I realized that it was no where to be found on Google search. Achieving a high rank on a search engine like Google is very important because that is how people find you. Search engines are also known as the best source for traffic because everyone uses it.
So to get on Google search I registered for Webmasters Tools and Analytics which requires you to put an XML sitemap and a script of code into your website so that you can appear on Google&amp;#8217;s index in order to get searched.</description>

      <description>This is an assignment question I had for my Design Patterns and Software Testing class.
Problem: 
You are given a project that is going to be used in a high school with 400 students. The application will store the student specifications along with the courses they take and corresponding marks into a database and applies some calculations for each student and each class. For example, the average of the marks of a specific course in a class, the number of failed students in a subject in a class, etc.</description>

&amp;nbsp;
Problem:
Car model website does not receive check box list items for drop down list items other than the first item.</description>

      <guid>https://phong.io/blog/2012-04-10-web-application-deployment-descriptor/</guid>
      <description>When working with servlets and java server pages, you need a web application deployment descriptor.
It is basically an XML file (usually called web.xml or application.xml) that tells the container about the web application.
It contains:
ServletContext initialization parameters
Servlet/JSP definitions
Servlet/JSP mappings
Welcome file list
Error pages
Problem:
JSP/Servlet page outputs a descriptor error.
Impact:
Your webpage will not run without a deployment descriptor
Solution:
Add the deployment descriptor to the project.</description>
