## Description
March 2014 - December 2014

**Technologies:** JavaScript, jQuery, ASP.NET with C#

ScribbleLive is a multilingual real-time content marketing and engagement platform used on various websites such as Samsung, CNET, CNN, Fast Company and many more.

I worked on multiple features using HTML & CSS and JavaScript with jQuery. Other technologies include ASP.NET 4.5, Git, Atlassian tools, Handlebars.js, Social APIs (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, Wikipedia).

My main task was to implement new features and improve existing features for the software platform by building out UI components and integrating them to the back end using AJAX and JSON for API calls. In addition, I was responsible for debugging issues & tickets for the platform which supports up to IE7.

## Major Projects
### Content Icons
Content icons are a feature that gives the user the ability to add custom or premade icons to their posts. It was successfully used during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and various news websites.

### Content and Audience Analytics Filter Pages
Content and audience filter pages are featured pages on the pro version of product. They are basically used as an analytics page to track prospects and the pages they were visiting.

### Live Scoreboard
Live scoreboard is a feature that adds real time, live scores from different sports to your platform, making it easier for visitors to view live content posts while seeing the live score.
