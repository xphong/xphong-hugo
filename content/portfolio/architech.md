## Description
December 2014 - December 2016

**Technologies:** JavaScript, AngularJS, ReactJS, Node.js, Java

Architech is a software consulting firm with a focus on mid to large sized enterprise projects. Clients include Rogers, Wind, Telus, LoyaltyOne, and many more.

I worked on multiple projects using diverse technologies such as HTML/CSS, AngularJS, ReactJS, and Node.js. Other technologies include Java, Git, Atlassian tools, Bootstrap with Sass/LESS, D3.js, WebSockets, Grunt/Gulp, Karma/Jasmine/Mocha and other various Front End Development tools.

Projects were built by working closely with teams of designers, developers, and a project manager in an agile team environment. Implementing projects with clean, scalable, testable, and maintainable code.

Major projects consisted of production websites/applications, front end prototypes, minimum viable products, and proof of concepts. Production projects included using best practices such as Agile Software Development with a focus on user experience. Innovative prototypes and proof of concepts used IoT technologies such as motion sensors, Microsoft Kinect, heatmaps, and beacons.
