## Description
January 2014

**Technologies:** PHP, WordPress

JAB FADC is a clothing brand that looks towards the fighting game community for inspiration while incorporating their own creativity and style.

The task was to develop a fully responsive single page website. This project required a user-friendly content management system where the client can easily add/edit/delete content from the web page. Another requirement was a simple shopping cart that can be managed by the client.

This was done using WordPress as the backend CMS which allows the client to add his own clothing designs whenever he wants. The Paypal shopping cart allows users to easily order items and checkout through Paypal's system. With WordPress in the backend, the client can easily view and manage cart orders in order to responsibly ship items.
