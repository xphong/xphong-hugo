So there is a new assignment for my project management class that requires me to write a weekly blog about my experiences in the Web Development program. Good news is that I have had this website up since September. Bad news is writing a weekly blog, haha.

After reading some blogging tips from Sean’s website I realized my blog posts should be consistent, this is like my first blog post after a month, so I will most likely be posting up my weekly blog post every Saturday.  Back to the bad news of writing a weekly blog, the biggest problem I know I will be having is writing 300 to 500 words every week. As you can see by my old blog posts I usually only write around 50-100 words. I would much rather be struggling with code than thinking of things to write about. Oh man I am only at around 145 words, and I was just about to press the publish button.

### Midterms

I guess I’ll talk about my midterms that just ended a week ago. I did very well in all of the courses. One thing that confused that crap out of me was the midterm marks on SRS. Apparently, some of the marks were only the midterm exam mark and others were a combined grade of assignments and the exam. Most of the people in my class struggled on the Web Application Development (ASP.NET) midterm. I personally felt that the Project Management midterm was the hardest even though it was a take home midterm. Basically, I had to write three 500-word essays about proposals… that took me all day. For the ASP.NET midterm, which was split up into a theory part and a practical part both worth 50% of the midterm, I had actually almost failed the theory part (I am terrible with multiple choice) and did amazing on the practical. Anyhow, I now know how I will be studying for the ASP.NET final if it is the same format.

Awesome over 300 words time to publish! Don’t worry I will try and write more for my next blog. Hopefully, I will have more things to write about.
