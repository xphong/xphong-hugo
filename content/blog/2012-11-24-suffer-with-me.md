Depressing title, I know. It is actually a line from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. I just recently finished the game, the story was pretty good by the way, and that line just stuck with me.

### Challenges

So the week is over, I was able to finish all my assignments on time and to the best of my abilities. The biggest challenge of the week for me was not even an assignment question. It was actually the installation of XAMPP, which is a software used to start the Apache server so that you can run .php documents on the localhost. This needed to be done in order to work on the Web Programming assignment involving AJAX. I had to work with a php file that Andre gave out to complete the assignment. The problem I ran into was that the Apache server did not start. Apparently there was a problem with the ports so I Google&#8217;d it. I ended up changing all of Apache server ports from 80 to 8080 and it worked. Awesome right? Wrong! I managed to finish the first two questions and I decided to do question three the next day. The next day comes and XAMPP did not work at all. The Apache server started but for some reason the locahost did not load anything. I was short on time so I just did the question without testing it. After handing it in I compared my last question with other classmates and surprisingly I was pretty close to the correct answer. Anyway, I still did not fix the problem with XAMPP and I know for sure that it is needed soon. I guess that problem is for future Phong to handle. It is back to gaming for now.

### Copyright

On another note, I am removing all the copyrighted (found on Google images) images on my blog. I remembering asking one of my professors, Sean, about this and he said he did not mind, but my other professor, Bernie, seems to be pretty serious on copyrighted images so I think it is best to remove them for good practice, and also to not get sued lol. The good thing is that the website Bernie suggested &#8211; <a title="Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a> has loads of free pictures. Hopefully I can find all the images I need to replace for my blog on that website.
