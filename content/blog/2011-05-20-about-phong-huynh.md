My name is **Phong Huynh**, and I am a Web Developer in Toronto, Canada. I have a Postgraduate Certificate in Web Development and a diploma in Computer Programming, both with honours standing.

At the young age of 13 I learned and taught myself how to use Adobe Photoshop 7 using online tutorials and videos. Using my self-taught skills I manipulated images to use as signature tags on forums and other various websites. During high school I started to take graphic design courses and programming courses. When I had to choose my post-secondary education I was stuck between choosing either graphic design or computer programming. I ended up taking computer programming because it was more versatile and I seem to enjoy it more. I've always had a passion for graphic design which is why I think web development is perfect for me. It has the combination of both design and code.

I have been coding since high school and I have completed my studies of Computer Programming and Web Development at Humber College. I used to generally code with Java, but now I mainly code in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. However, I am open to learning new languages because I am able to adapt and pick up a new language rather quickly.

In my free time I play guitar, read, play video games, watch TV shows and exercise.
