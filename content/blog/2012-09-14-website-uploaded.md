The website is now uploaded after struggling with a few problems inside the database.

Originally, I had this website uploaded on a /test directory so I can see that everything was running perfectly. However, when I moved my website to the root it caused some problems because of the database. When I uploaded my database it was all directed to the /test directory so that I can test my website. When moving the site into the root all of the paths in the database led to /test which was why all of my content did not show in the root.

To fix this I exported my database file and changed all the links that have https://phong.io/test to https://phong.io and then imported my new database file.

Anyways this website would not have been uploaded without the help of a friend and of course, the almighty Google search.

Here is his website: <a title="Amit Jakhu" href="http://www.amitjakhu.com/" target="_blank">Amit Jakhu</a>, I used his website as a sort of guide, designers usually have the best portfoliosÂ after all.
