### Reflection

Semester 1 is finished and my grades were awesome, although one class could have been better. That class was, of course, Project Management. It was expected because I spent the least effort in that class. The presentation went great, everyone in my group was well prepared. However, we ran into a couple of problems: 1) Our mouse did not work so someone else had to change the slides for the speaker. and 2) We had a duo tang instead of a binder for our documents. My part for the presentation went well, I ran into some blanks when I was talking but luckily the preparation helped me through it. It was like I was speaking on auto-pilot. Now I think I am fairly comfortable with presentations, especially considering I used to avoid class because of presentations back in high school. Web Application Development (ASP.NET) was one of my highest marks. I can remember being all pessimistic about that class. In an earlier blog post I said that I only had three tables to work with when the required was 5, fortunately Gurpal (the professor) allowed everyone to do extra controls for a table to meet the 5 controls required. I also destroyed the final exam, even with the multiple choice. A lot of classmates were complaining about how there were so many things from the midterm on it, but I specifically remembered Gurpal saying that there would be. On a final note for the reflection, my semester school notes are all over the place. I hope to be more organized this second semester.

### Looking Forward

So a week has passed in the new semester. The main things I got out of the first week, or actually remembered, was that there are two major projects. One is an ASP.NET website for the hospital, and a PHP website for a fictional eBusiness. I am not too worried about the other courses because I have taken career connections and XML in my previous Computer Programming program. I am very excited to learn PHP and to start establishing my Web Developer portfolio. Both of these websites are of course in groups. The ASP.NET website group was chosen by the professors, and the PHP groups were our choice. However, I did not really get to choose my group because I was late. It was my own fault, but I kind of like my randomized group. Originally, it was suppose to be groups of 3 which I think is a good number but the class wanted groups of 4 for some reason. My randomized group has two people with thick accents so it is going to be a huge challenge working with them. Oh yeah, I am also mad that we are stuck in J132, it is the crappier lab with the crappy keyboards.
