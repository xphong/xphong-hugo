Have you ever had that little error that messed up your whole project? Back in programming, I remember when I used to miss variable names and the program would not run. However, Java would tell you exactly where the error is. This week I was working on my second assignment for Digital Design, which requires me to code my mock-up website from assignment 1 into html/css. I made the mistake of putting a pretty looking slider in the mock-up because I did not know this assignment was coming&#8230; So for the website I had to use a jQuery slider plugin for my slider. It was my first time using a jQuery plugin so I had no idea what I was doing. I ended up having a problem with the navigation arrows not showing up. At first, I thought it was most likely the referencing to the arrow pictures. In the provided CSS file it was:

_background: url(images/right-arrow.png);Â _

### The Problem

This seemed correct to me.Â I actually spent hours trying to google this problem, searching things like jQuery slider arrows not showing and jQuery navigation problem. After hours of googling, and a couple of Call of Duty breaks (Black Ops 2 just came out this week lol), I finally found an example of the jQuery slider except the person used _../images/right-arrow.png_. I remember from my old Unix class that .. is the parent directory, and I realized that the css file was in a separate folder called css. This means that the reference _images/right-arrow.png_ refers to the currect directory where there is no images folder. So using _../images_ would correctly reference the navigation arrows, and of course fix the **whole problem.**

Anyway, here&#8217;s an image of my fully functional slider ðŸ™‚

### Notes!

On another note, I have to get a new binder because of all the SQL Database and ASP.NET notes. It seems like Gurpal and Bill are working together to destroy all the trees. I literally have over 200 pages of notes for both classes. It was really surprising this week when Gurpal only gave out 3 pages of notes for the Web Application Development. We are starting to learn ADO.NET, which is what I am more familiar with from my previous programming course so hopefully I can get some extra marks out of this section.

Next week is going to be pretty tough, there is an assignment due for each class. Wish me luck!
